- **Account Locked Guidance**: Instructions for users with locked accounts
- **Password Reset UI**: Intuitive interface for password changes
- **Help Documentation**: Comprehensive user and admin guides

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Edge Functions
All security-critical operations are handled server-side using Supabase Edge Functions:

- **`login-user`**: Handles authentication with bcrypt verification
- **`reset-password`**: Manages secure password changes
- **`check-account-status`**: Provides real-time account status

### Database Schema
Security-related fields in the `staff` table:
```sql
- account_status: 'active' | 'locked' | 'inactive'
- failed_login_attempts: integer (default 0)
- last_failed_login: timestamp
- locked_at: timestamp
- password: text (bcrypt hashed)
```

### Security Utilities
- **Input Validation**: Username and password format validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Client-side rate limiting with localStorage
- **Security Logging**: Comprehensive event logging system
- **Token Validation**: JWT token structure and expiration checking

## üîÑ Security Workflows

### User Login Flow
1. **Input Validation**: Check username format and password length
2. **Rate Limiting**: Verify user hasn't exceeded attempt limits
3. **Account Status Check**: Ensure account is not locked
4. **Authentication**: Verify credentials with bcrypt
5. **Token Generation**: Create JWT token with expiration
6. **Session Storage**: Store token and user info securely

### Account Lockout Flow
1. **Failed Attempt**: Record failed login with timestamp
2. **Counter Increment**: Increase failed_login_attempts
3. **Threshold Check**: Lock account after 3rd failure
4. **Status Update**: Set account_status to 'locked'
5. **Auto-unlock Timer**: Schedule unlock after 24 hours
6. **Admin Override**: Allow manual unlock by admin

### Password Reset Flow
1. **Authentication**: Verify current password
2. **Validation**: Check new password requirements
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attempts
4. **Hashing**: Generate new bcrypt hash
5. **Database Update**: Store new password hash
6. **Session Invalidation**: Force re-login with new password

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Protection Against Common Attacks

**SQL Injection**
- All database queries use parameterized statements
- Input sanitization removes dangerous characters
- Supabase RLS policies provide additional protection

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- Input sanitization removes HTML tags and scripts
- Content Security Policy headers
- React's built-in XSS protection

**Brute Force Attacks**
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Progressive delays between attempts

**Session Hijacking**
- JWT tokens with short expiration times
- Secure token storage
- Token validation on each request

**Password Attacks**
- Bcrypt hashing with high cost factor
- Salt generation for each password
- Password strength requirements

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Logged Events
- `LOGIN_SUCCESS`: Successful authentication
- `LOGIN_FAILED`: Failed login attempt
- `LOGIN_ERROR`: System error during login
- `ACCOUNT_LOCKED`: Account locked due to failures
- `ACCOUNT_UNLOCKED`: Account unlocked by admin
- `PASSWORD_RESET_SUCCESS`: Successful password change
- `PASSWORD_RESET_FAILED`: Failed password change attempt
- `SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY`: Unusual activity detected

### Monitoring Dashboard
Admins can access security monitoring through:
- **Account Management Tab**: Search and manage user accounts
- **Security Test Panel**: Test security features
- **Security Documentation**: Complete user guides
- **Implementation Summary**: Feature status overview

## üöÄ Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
Required secrets in Supabase Edge Functions:
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Database connection URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Public API key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Admin API key
- `JWT_SECRET`: Token signing secret

### Database Policies
Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure:
- Users can only access their own data
- Admins have full access to all data
- Security logs are protected from tampering

### Performance Optimization
- Rate limiting uses localStorage for client-side caching
- Security logs are limited to last 100 events per user
- Database indexes on security-related fields

## üîß Maintenance & Updates

### Regular Security Tasks
1. **Review Security Logs**: Check for suspicious activity weekly
2. **Update Dependencies**: Keep security libraries current
3. **Password Policy Review**: Evaluate password requirements quarterly
4. **Access Review**: Audit admin accounts monthly
5. **Backup Security Data**: Regular backups of security logs

### Security Updates
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Update bcrypt cost factor as computing power increases
- Review and update rate limiting thresholds
- Enhance logging based on new threat patterns

## üìà Metrics & KPIs
